## About The Project



<h3 align="center">Overview:</h3> 
This Python script is designed to streamline the process of extracting classnames from config.cpp files.
This does assume the config file is in a standard DayZ format, so usage may vary. This will only write classnames which have a scope of 2 to output file, avoiding _base or _colorbase classnames.
This is done through use of REGEX, because i'm not writing a cpp parser just to pull classnames out of a config file.
